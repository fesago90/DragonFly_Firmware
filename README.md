v1.0:
This version of flight control firmware for dragonfly is a verified roll control version.
Roll stabilization was completed with the following hardware features:
1. Brown wings (blue wings gave even better performance);
2. 40W main motor running at 100% PWM, which gave around 50g lift on four wings;
3. Moongel dampener with two 2S LiPo batteries attached to MARC to increase inertia.

v2.0:
Dragonfly control code for the configuration of four wings for roll
control, two front and back props for pitch control, and one rear servo
for yaw control.
This version of code works with the SDK version of v1.7.2.
